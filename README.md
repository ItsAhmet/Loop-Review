# Loop-Review





Looping Exercises
Assignment Sheet

Be sure to include good commenting, especially to explain the loops.  Also include user friendly output.

Multiples Method
Write a program that will print out the multiples of a number.  Ask the user for the number and how many multiples to print out.
	Example:  First 5 multiples of 4 are : 4, 8, 12, 16, 20

Factorial Method

Write a program that will calculate the factorial of a number the user inputs.  For example, the factorial of 5 is 120 since 5! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 = 120

Prime Method

Write a program that allows the user to input a number.  Tell the user if it is prime.  If it is not, tell what its factors are.

loops
“population”	

Write a class that will predict the size of a population of organisms. The class should store the starting number of organisms, their average daily population increase (as a percentage), and the number of days they will multiply. The class should have a method that uses a loop to display the size of the population for each day.
Test the class in a program that asks the user for the starting size of the population, their average daily increase, and the number of days they will multiply. The program should display the daily population.


Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 2 for the starting size of the population.
Do not accept a negative number for average daily population increase. Do not accept a
number less than 1 for the number of days they will multiply.


Example Output:

Input initial population size==> 100

Enter population increase as a percentage 
(e.g. .20 for 20%, 1.5 for 150%) ==> .15

Input number of days to run==> 10

10 days at 15.0 percent increase will produce:

Day 1	Daily Population: 100
Day 2	Daily Population: 115
Day 3	Daily Population: 132
Day 4	Daily Population: 151
Day 5	Daily Population: 173
Day 6	Daily Population: 198
Day 7	Daily Population: 227
Day 8	Daily Population: 261
Day 9	Daily Population: 300
Day 10	Daily Population: 345
